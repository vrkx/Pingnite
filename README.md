# Pingnite
Pingnite is a free tool to check whats the closest fortnite server to you, to help you get less ping than you have when connected to auto servers.

# Why is this so useful?

This is very useful to check what's the best connection and less latency you have on servers, Since sometimes when your Server is set to "Auto" it connects you to a random server, that's why Pro Players never have their servers on auto.
